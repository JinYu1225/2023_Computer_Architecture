# Assignment 1: RISC-V Assembly and Instruction Pipeline
The goal of Homework 1 is to modify the concepts that was illustrated in  
the [Quiz1_2023](https://hackmd.io/@sysprog/arch2023-quiz1-sol).  
We should choose one concept from Problem A to C, transfer the C code to  
RISC-V assembly code, and use the concept to complete further function.  
The concept I choose is "Count Leading Zero (CLZ)" and the extended function  
is "The Image Binarization".  
To focus on the implement of binarization and CLZ, I assume the input has  
already been transfer into array type.  
The main function is to let the pixels (elements) convert to 0 if they are  
smaller than the "Threshold". And convert to 255 if bigger.  
* The CLZ concept is mainly used in comparing the scalar of the elements.  
* The [note page](https://hackmd.io/@edenlin/BkuFYLOxa) is proposed.  
  
# Assignment 2: GNU Toolchain  
In Assignment 2, we were asked for modifying other students' code and  
optimizing it by the [rv32emu](https://github.com/sysprog21/rv32emu).  
We need to learn how the emulator work in this assignment and analyze the  
difference between the handwriting assembly code and the code generated by  
the compiler, and try to optimize both of them.
